Project for UVA Master course Agent Based Modelling

The model.py file defines the functionality of the model. Here agent classes and their behaviour are defined. The GeoModel class defines how the model is intitialized (creation of agents) and what changes are run in what order.

The server.py file runs the model and visualises it in browser. Adapt this file to change color of the environment or the agents. Add sliders or parameter settings to the model.
